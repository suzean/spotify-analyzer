This is an app that analyzes either your recent or top played tracks on Spotify and allows you to generate new songs based on specific track data.


To be able to use it you need to login using your Spotify credentials, after you get the below view:

#1 The first column:
- Pulls data from your listening history, 10 most recently played songs or 10 top song -> top songs are being generated based on 3 time frames short(last 4 weeks)/medium(last 6 months)/long(last year)
- You can click the "Analyze" button on any of the songs which will redirect you to the second column.

#2 The second column:
- After you chose one of the tracks from your history you can hover over the Headset icon to listen to a 30s sample of the track.
- Below the Info header you can see a chart with some track-specific data that gives you an insight into some of the Audio Features of the song.
- All showcased features have longer explanations below the chart with color-coordinated icons to help you navigate.

#3 The third column:
- After clicking the "Start/Refresh" button the app takes the ID of the song chosen in the second column and based on its genre and tempo generates a list of 10 similar ones.
- You can use the "Try Me" button which starts up a Spotify Player right in your browser at the top of your screen.
- The Player is linked directly to your Spotify account and you can add the currently listened to song to your Library by clicking the heart icon beside the title.

(*Disclaimer* ->
The Spotify Player works only if you have a Premium subscription with Spotify.)


Enjoy!
